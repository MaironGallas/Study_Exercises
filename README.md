`Ten Minute Walk` --> 1

You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. 
You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. 
The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- 
everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). 
You always walk only a single block for each letter (direction) and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, 
so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) 
and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.

Note: you will always receive a valid array (string in COBOL) containing a random assortment of direction letters ('n', 's', 'e', or 'w' only). 
It will never give you an empty array (that's not a walk, that's standing still!).

`Sum of two lowest positive integers` --> 2

Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.

For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

[10, 343445353, 3453445, 3453545353453] should return 3453455.

`Sum of Numbers` --> 3

Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!

(1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)

(1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)

`Create Phone Number` --> 4

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

Example

create_phone_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) # => returns "(123) 456-7890"

The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.
Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!

`Detect Pangram` --> 5

A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.


`Duplicate Encode` --> 6

The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

Example

"din"      =>  "((("

"recede"   =>  "()()()"

"Success"  =>  ")())())"

"(( @"     =>  "))((" 

`Ones and Zeros` --> 7

Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

Examples:
Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5


`Multiples of 3 or 5` --> 8

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.


`Moving Zeros To The End` --> 9

Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

move_zeros([1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3]) # returns [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 0, 0]


`Does my number look big in this? Narcissistic Number`--> 10

A Narcissistic Number is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).

For example, take 153 (3 digits), which is narcisstic:

1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153

The Challenge:

Your code must return true or false (not 'true' and 'false') depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number in base 10. This may be True and False in your language, e.g. PHP.

Error checking for text strings or other invalid inputs is not required, only valid positive non-zero integers will be passed into the function.
