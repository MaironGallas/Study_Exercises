`Ten Minute Walk`

You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. 
You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. 
The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- 
everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). 
You always walk only a single block for each letter (direction) and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, 
so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) 
and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.

Note: you will always receive a valid array (string in COBOL) containing a random assortment of direction letters ('n', 's', 'e', or 'w' only). 
It will never give you an empty array (that's not a walk, that's standing still!).

`Sum of two lowest positive integers`

Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.

For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

[10, 343445353, 3453445, 3453545353453] should return 3453455.

`Sum of Numbers`

Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!

(1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)

(1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)

`Create Phone Number`

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

Example

create_phone_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) # => returns "(123) 456-7890"

The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.
Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!
